# AI Attendance System - Project Documentation

## 1. Introduction
The AI Attendance System is a modern, face-recognition-based application designed to automate the process of tracking attendance. By leveraging computer vision and real-time communication, it provides a seamless experience for both administrators and users.

## 2. Problem Statement
Traditional attendance systems often rely on manual entry, physical ID cards, or fingerprint scanners. These methods face several challenges:
- **Manual Errors:** Human error in recording or data entry.
- **Proxy Attendance:** Users marking attendance for others (buddy punching).
- **Inefficiency:** Long queues and slow processing times.
- **Hygiene Concerns:** Physical contact with shared devices (especially relevant in post-pandemic scenarios).

**Our Solution:** A touchless, automated system that uses facial recognition to verify identity and record attendance instantly.

## 3. Implementation Plan
The project was planned with a modular architecture to ensure scalability and cross-platform compatibility.

### Key Objectives:
1.  **Facial Recognition:** Implement a robust client-side face detection and recognition engine.
2.  **Real-time Sync:** Ensure attendance logs are updated instantly across all connected devices.
3.  **Cross-Platform:** Support Web, PWA, and Native Mobile (Android/iOS).
4.  **User Experience:** Provide a clean, theme-aware (Dark/Light) interface.

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend:** React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS.
- **Animations:** Framer Motion (Motion).
- **Icons:** Lucide React.
- **Face AI:** `face-api.js`.
- **Real-time:** Socket.io.
- **Mobile Wrapper:** Capacitor.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.

## 4. Actual Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Face Recognition Engine
We integrated `face-api.js` to handle face detection and feature extraction.
- **Models:** Loaded pre-trained models for face detection (SSD Mobilenet V1) and face recognition (Face Recognition Model).
- **Registration:** Users "register" by capturing their face. The system extracts a "descriptor" (a unique numerical representation of the face) and saves it.
- **Scanning:** During attendance, the system compares the live camera feed descriptor against the stored database of descriptors.

### Step 2: Real-time Backend
A Node.js server with Socket.io was implemented to handle data synchronization.
- **Events:** The server listens for `attendance-marked` and `user-registered` events.
- **Broadcasting:** When a record is updated, the server broadcasts the change to all connected clients, updating their "History" and "Summary" views instantly.

### Step 3: Theme and UI
Using Tailwind CSS, we built a responsive dashboard.
- **Dark Mode:** Implemented using CSS variables and Tailwind's utility classes.
- **Persistence:** User theme preference is saved to `localStorage`.

## 5. Integration Process

### PWA and Mobile Integration
To make the app available on Android and iOS:
1.  **Manifest:** Created a `manifest.json` for PWA support.
2.  **Capacitor:** Initialized Capacitor to wrap the web app into native containers.
3.  **Service Workers:** Implemented a service worker for offline caching and "Install App" functionality.

### Integration Flow:
1.  **Camera Access:** The app requests permission to use the device camera.
2.  **Model Loading:** AI models are fetched from the `/models` directory.
3.  **Socket Connection:** The client establishes a persistent connection to the backend server.
4.  **Data Flow:** 
    - User scans face -> Descriptor generated.
    - Descriptor matched -> Attendance event sent to Socket.io.
    - Server updates state -> Broadcasts to all clients.

## 7. How to Use the System

1.  **Registration:**
    - Navigate to the **Register** tab.
    - Enter your name.
    - Click **Scan Face** to capture your facial features.
2.  **Marking Attendance:**
    - Navigate to the **Scan** tab.
    - Ensure your face is visible in the camera.
    - The system will automatically recognize you and mark your attendance.
3.  **Viewing History:**
    - Go to the **History** tab.
    - View live logs of everyone who has scanned.
    - Check the **Daily Summary** to see who is present or absent.
